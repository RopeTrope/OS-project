# 🚀 Minimal Multithreaded Kernel for RISC-V

This project is a **minimal kernel** developed for the **RISC-V** architecture. It features a custom-built **multithreading system**, along with a **memory allocator**, **thread management**, and **semaphore-based synchronization**.

---

## 🧠 Features

- 🧵 **Multithreading:** Lightweight thread abstraction and context switching.
- 📦 **Memory Allocator:** Custom dynamic memory allocation for kernel-level tasks.
- 🧰 **Thread Manager:** Handles creation, scheduling, and termination of threads.
- 🔒 **Semaphores:** Basic synchronization primitives for inter-thread communication.
- 🏗️ **RISC-V Architecture:** Designed specifically for RISC-V.
